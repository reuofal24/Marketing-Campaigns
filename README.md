# Marketing-Campaigns
## Applied Data Science with Python Project - Data Science and Artificial Intelligence T5

### As part of these projects, we had an important Data Science with Python project titled "Marketing Campaigns" This project centered around a marketing mix problem scenario, a common concept used in implementing marketing strategies. The marketing mix involves multiple areas of focus as part of a comprehensive marketing plan, revolving around the four elements of marketing: product, price, place, and promotion. The project's goal was to understand the different factors that contribute to customer acquisition through exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing.

### We implemented the programming steps using Python in Google Colab, writing specific code to conduct exploratory data analysis and test hypotheses related to the four marketing elements. The scenario, along with the steps and guidelines, was included in a separate file from the code solution, along with two data tables: marketing and index.
